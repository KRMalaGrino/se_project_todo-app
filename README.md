# The Todo App

A convenient "to-do" application for the cellphone or computer to help one stay ontop of priority tasks . Users can add a new "todo", check-off completed "to-dos" with the checkbox & use the delete button .

## Functionality & Technology

This project was heavily focused on javascript using refactoring , classes and import & export statements . All code was already written for us before hand . We had an individual file path for each individual class . The code ended up being much more organized than the beginning of the project .
